# FAQs

If you are new to the project or Behat, we recommend that you first [read through our documentation](https://wordhat.info/). For any questions, feedback, or to contribute, you can get in contact with us via Github or our [Slack](https://wordhat.herokuapp.com).

## Javascript
* If you are using [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/) to run Javascript tests, and you access your WordPress site over HTTPS, *and* it has a self-signed certificate, you will need to manually configure the web browser to accept that certificate.

## WP-CLI
* If you are using the WP-CLI driver to [connect to a remote WordPress site over SSH](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/running-commands-remotely/), WordHat assumes the remote server is Linux-like, with a shell that provides [GNU Coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html).
